Over 118 years later, Jacobs' map and field notes were rediscovered, spawning a search for information about the school and its location. Based on the 1891 survey map, the school was named the “1891 Schoolhouse. ” Using field notes and the map as a guide, the location of the schoolhouse was identified.",

This group left Abiquiu, New Mexico, in November of 1829 with a horse and mule pack train loaded with woven goods to sell in California. They followed a route that took them through the Four Corners area to the Colorado River where the Dominquez-Escalante party had crossed in 1776. From this crossing, the route headed across northeastern Arizona to the Virgin River in Utah.",

    "description": "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness to protect its essential wilderness character and fragile environment while providing the visitor with a world class opportunity for primitive and unconfined recreation. Expect the wild! There are no designated trails, campsites, signs, or facilities within the wilderness boundaries. The land is rugged and hikers should be in good condition to pass through dense riparian vegetation (a sign of a healthy ecosystem). All visitors should wear sturdy footwear suitable for hiking in sand, gravel, and cobble with potential for numerous stream crossings in knee-deep water. From the West trailhead (2,630 feet), expect a continuous 430 feet elevation gain over uneven terrain for 12. 25 miles to the East trailhead (3,060 feet). There are multiple side canyons, caves, outcrops, chimneys, and \"windows\" to explore along your way. Strong or destination hikers can traverse from end to end in 8 to 10 hours, while nature watchers, photographers and those wanting to explore side canyons may take one or two nights. Aravaipa Creek flows year-round, an unusual phenomenon in the Arizona desert. Nurtured by this abundant water, large sycamore, ash, cottonwood, and willow trees flourish along the stream, flanked by other riparian vegetation. In the fall, a kaleidoscope of brilliant red and golden leaves contrasts dramatically with the surrounding Sonoran Desert landscape. Overview:With towering cliffs, flowing water and a rich diversity of flora and fauna, Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness remains as one of Arizona's truly unique areas. Its 19,410 acres of designated Wilderness beckons adventurers who yearn for solitude and scenic splendor. Located in southeast Arizona, roughly between Tucson and Phoenix, the Wilderness and surrounding public and private land conserve a vital ecosystem for future generations.",

For the first 16 miles, the trail follows the Susan River. As it winds through the rugged Susan River Canyon, the trail crosses the river 12 times on bridges and trestles and passes through two tunnels. The landscape is a combination of semi-arid canyon and upland forests of pine and fir. Most of the trail traverses the Susan River Canyon with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and reminders of the railroad and logging days of the past. The remarkable autumn colors and scenery along the Bizz Johnson Trail earned it one of eight feature spots on the Rails-To-Trails Conservancy's 1997 \"Fall Foliage on the Web\" rail-trails guide.

Fishing the Blackfoot River: The section of the Blackfoot River from Government Dam to Trail Creek Bridge is a distance of 23 river miles. This section of river is floatable in a canoe, kayak, small raft or small drift boat. Put-ins and take-outs are undeveloped. Floating is not recommended below Trail Creek Bridge due to Class IV and above rapids. The Blackfoot River below Government Dam flows through breath-taking scenery of rolling hills and canyons. Typical summer water flows range from 200 to 800 cubic feet per second (CFS). The river is full of rock gardens and boulders and generally cannot be floated when flows drop below 100 CFS.

    "description": "BLM manages more than 90,000 acres of public lands in the Bruneau-Jarbidge Rivers Wilderness. The Owyhee Canyonlands is a huge and remote area of eastern Oregon, southwestern Idaho and northern Nevada. Hidden within this vast high desert plateau are deep canyons carved by the Owyhee, Bruneau and Jarbidge Rivers. The rivers of the Owyhee and Bruneau-Jarbidge systems offer something for nearly every level of boating experience. The Owyhee and Bruneau-Jarbidge river systems provide visitors with unsurpassed solitude in canyons of unique beauty and form. From placid pools to turbulent whitewater; from vertical cliffs to steep grassy slopes; and from wildlife, such as California bighorn sheep to wildflowers, including the Bruneau River flox, these rivers and their canyons present visitors with challenging and extraordinary experiences. The rivers offer challenging whitewater boating in an isolated setting. The canyons and plateau provide ample opportunity for those who wish to explore the area on foot. Sportsmen will find excellent fishing for trout and hunting for upland birds and some big game. The truly adventurous can explore 180,000 acres of pristine lands in two nearby Wilderness Study Areas. The upper canyon is the most scenic part and the easiest floating. Boaters can take out near the scenic overlook at Rogerson, but you have to climb out of the steep canyon. The second half, through Five Mile Rapids and Hot Springs Creek is rocky and requires a lot of maneuvering. Only experienced boaters should attempt the lower part of the Bruneau, especially at high water. The drive to the put-in is an experience in itself, and you should be prepared. Go with someone who knows the way, or hire a shuttle driver in Bruneau. From the confluence of the two rivers to south of Bruneau is 56 miles of class II-IV rapids.

Elevation ranges from 3200 feet atop Brushy Sky High, down to 600 feet in the eastern end of Cache Creek along State Route 16. Showcasing the area is about 35 miles of the main fork of Cache Creek and 2. 5 miles of the north fork. The Cache Creek Natural Area is a primitive area, closed to motorized vehicles. There are no developed campgrounds or facilities. Non-hunting (target) shooting is not allowed. Instead, the area is managed to improve habitat for wildlife and rare plants, to protect cultural resource values, and to offer primitive recreation opportunities, including wildlife viewing, river running, hiking, equestrian use, hunting and fishing. On October 17, 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act, designating approximately 27,245 acres within the Cache Creek Natural Area (CCNA) as the Cache Creek Wilderness Area.

    "description": "Carrizo Plain National Monument is home to a number of curiously beautiful sights, both natural and man-made. Among those, visitors can expect to see an ancient rock art site, a creek bed disrupted by the San Andreas Fault and a lake filled with a glistening layer of white salt. Adjacent to the southwest edge of the San Joaquin Valley, the Carrizo Plain National Monument is a 250,000-acre oasis as well as a diverse complex of habitats for many endangered, threatened and rare species of plants and animals. Soda Lake covers an area of about 3,000 acres and is one of the most dominant geographic features of the Carrizo Plain. As a result of evaporating mineral-laden surface water, a crust has formed in the lake, creating a glistening white bed of salt that has become a famous attraction for Carrizo. The Carrizo Plain is traversed by the San Andreas Fault, providing spectacular topography along the eastern edge. Ridges rise sharply from the plain to form the Panorama and Elkhorn Hills. Temporary pools and salt-encrusted ponds appear along the fault, trapping rainwater to create stunning scenery. Painted Rock, a large, U-shaped rock outcrop just south of the Goodwin Education Center, features what was once an elaborate, multicolored pictograph site created by the Chumash, a Native American people who historically inhabited the coastal regions of California. Both the interior and exterior sides have paintings, which include geometric images as well as human figures, snakes and aquatic images. There are numerous seasonal recreational opportunities for visitors, many of them focused on the plain's abundant birds and wildflowers. Aside from the organized tours available, hiking, biking, birding, wildlife viewing and scenic drives are all popular activities for guests. The San Andreas, Soda Lake, Elkhorn and Seven Mile roads within the monument, all combine to offer a stunning 70-mile scenic loop drive, and the nearby Goodwin Educational Center provides interpretive exhibits and other educational programs. Overview: Carrizo Plain National Monument is home to a number of curiously beautiful sights, both natural and man-made.

    "description": "One of the main features of the BLM, Dave Moore Nature Area is a loop trail about a mile long which goes from the parking lot trail head to the South Fork American River and back again passing through several habitat types. Nestled in the heart of Gold Rush Country, the trail is lined with remnants from nearly 150 years ago when Chinese laborers channeled creek water by hand with pick and shovel for gold mining. Tailing piles from the Gold Rush period blanket the area which lend to the characteristic landscape that makes this area so unique. As you travel along the Dave Moore Nature Trail you will encounter several natural features - most interesting is \"Mushroom Rock\" - two stacked granite boulders with a softer layer of decomposed granite in between that has been weathered by the river of the past. Look for the tall Ponderosa pine trees too big in diameter to put your arms around. And the majestic California Madrone tree in all it's awesome beauty is worth a stop to feel it's cooling smooth bark. Throughout the trail are hand made walls of lichen and moss covered rocks which guide your way to the South Fork American River -- your destination easily reached within a half mile from the parking lot trailhead. After you explore the cooling rivers edge, you can return along the trail the same way you came or choose to take the lower loop back up to the parking area. Within the half mile loop back you travel thru shaded riparian habitat and oak woodland. You will encounter large Incense cedar trees towering above you, gigantic granite boulders three times your height in amazing configurations and sizes, and beautiful native wildflowers, shrubs and trees of the local area. Listen as birds call out to alert your presence on the trail. Enjoy being surprised by the lizard in the grass scurrying across to greet you. And see if you can find what little treasures have been left behind. Please read about Hiking on Public Lands Remember your OUTDOOR ETHICS when enjoying your public lands. Please RECREATE RESPONSIBLY. What you need to know: Dave Moore Nature Area is a Day-Use area only. No overnight camping. No equestrian use on trail. CLOSED to all hunting and target shooting.

The Sundance Trail can be reached from highway U- 95 by a series of dirt roads. These roads may at times require a vehicle with up to six inches of clearance. Four wheel drive vehicles are recommended. Roads may be muddy or impassable during and after rains. 1. From the turnoff to Natural Bridges National Monument, travel west on U-95 for approximately 35 miles to the sign marking Glen Canyon National Recreation Area boundary. Drive about 1.4 miles further on U-95 and turn right onto the first dirt road after the White Canyon Bridge (just before milepost 53 on U-95). Travel 5 miles on San Juan County (SJC) road 2731 to a Y intersection with SJC 2081. Turn right onto SJC 2081. 2. If coming from Lake Powell on U-95, travel about one mile east from the Hite Marina turnoff. Turn left onto a dirt road directly across from milepost 49. this road is marked SJC 2081. Travel about four miles to a Y-intersection with SJC 2731. Stay on SJC 2081. This is where the two routes meet, so from either direction travel about 3.4 miles where you will come to a Y-intersection. Do not turn, but this road becomes SJC 256. Stay on 256 for 3.5 miles until you see a wooden BLM sign for the Sundance Trailhead. Continue to the parking lot. Walk the two track road from the parking lot to the trailhead and to the edge of the canyon. From here, the trail descends a 50% talus slope and 1,120 vertical feet into Dark Canyon.",

Moving away from the cool shade of the riparian zone, one immediately enters a desert environment dominated by salt shrubs and bunch grasses. There is a small sagebrush zone that gives way to pinyon and juniper slopes. The view is always dominated by rock and cliff. Douglas fir finds a home in protected, well watered alcoves. Over sixty riffles and rapids punctuate the trip. None are particularly difficult - a dozen or so can cause some trouble for the unprepared traveler. Camping tends to be idyllic on a clean sandy beach in front of a grove of cottonwood trees which offer shade and a windbreak. More than 60 side canyons descend from the plateau to meet the Green River. Every side canyon holds a surprise. In a few, a cold, clear stream pours into a warm silty river. Prehistoric rock art is prolific along with the ruins of dwellings, towers and granaries. Between Sand Wash and Nefertiti Rapid, users set their own itinerary. There are a number of hiking trails in the canyon. Of the 84 mile long river segment, 66 miles are within the Desolation Canyon Wilderness Study Area - the largest in the lower 48 states. The Desolation Canyon National Historic Landmark (NHL) extends one mile on either side of the river from Nine Mile Creek to Florence Creek. The NHL was designated by the Secretary of the Interior in 1969 as part of the centennial celebration of the 1869 exploration of the Green and Colorado Rivers by John Wesley Powell. There is a primitive boat ramp at Sand Wash, a primitive eight-site campground, a contact/information station, staffed ranger station and toilets. Trash receptacles and water are not provided. With the remoteness of the area groups can camp the night before at Sand Wash. Due to frequent mosquito plagues, Sand Wash offers four campsites with screened cabins. Contact the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Price Field Office for cabin reservations at (435) 636-3600. This contrasts with the more developed Swaseys Boat Ramp where there is a large concrete boat ramp along with improved parking, toilets and trash removal services. River left, (east of the river) of the Ute Tribal Lands (above Coal Creek) has a 75 foot buffer that allows camping with a permit issued from the Ute Tribe. All recreational activities (e. g. hiking, sightseeing) on the river left (east side of the river) without a tribal permit are strictly prohibited. You must hold a valid, BLM Desolation Canyon permit prior to obtaining the Ute Tribal permit. Ute Tribal permits may be purchased online.

There are several world class mountain biking trails in the area as well. The recreation opportunities in the area are truly boundless.

There are hundreds of miles of trails, Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service lands, state parks, the Lewis and Clark Trail and so much more.

Archaeologists call these rock writings petroglyphs and estimate that darker petroglyphs are older because the patina (dark varnish on the rocks) has had more time to develop. Grimes Point has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1972. Visitors today can view four distinct styles of petroglyphs at Grimes Point along the quarter-mile self-guided Petroglyph Trail.",

The lakes were originally natural depressions that accumulated water seasonally and were sustained by small springs. The lakes have since been deepened by homesteaders and farmers.

Decades ago the lakes were stocked with fish - blue gill, bass, and crappie - which are the primary catch today. Cliffs and sloping bluffs of basalt separate the shoreline and canyon bottom from the upland desert.

    "description": "Located in the southeast corner of California, the Imperial Sand Dunes are the largest mass of sand dunes in the state. Formed by windblown sands of ancient Lake Cahuilla, the dune system extends for more than 40 miles in a band averaging 5 miles wide. Dunes often reach heights of 300 feet above the desert floor, providing outstanding opportunities for recreation. A favorite place for off-highway vehicle (OHV) enthusiasts, the dunes also offer fabulous scenery, opportunities for solitude, and a home to rare plants and animals. With most of the off-road action taking place in the recreation area south of Highway 78, the open areas allow all types of vehicle recreation. Limited areas surround the dunes require vehicles to travel on designated routes. Closed areas prohibit motorized vehicle use entirely. Information and maps for all of these areas are available at the ranger stations. The North Algodones Dunes Wilderness offers a tranquil alternative to the fast-paced action of the main dunes. This wilderness encompasses more than 26,000 acres, with the largest and tallest dunes located in the central area. Visitors are welcome to walk or ride horses in this remote area. The wilderness is closed to all vehicles and mechanized use. Overview Located in the southeast corner of California, the Imperial Sand Dunes are the largest mass of sand dunes in the state.

Other than junipers, no trees grow in significant numbers here, but many bushes and flowers bloom wondrously come spring, although the mountains that separate western and eastern Washington generally wring the moisture from the air.",

There is cell service for most providers at the campground entrance. Loop B campsites are available first-come, first serve only. Payments can be made by cash, check, or scan and pay through the Recreation. gov mobile app. Please contact the BLM Moab Field Office with questions by email: [email protected] or phone: 435-259-2100. Ken's Lake Campground is a part of the Ken's Lake Recreation Area. The area includes Ken's Lake, a man made reservoir (electric motors only - gas powered engines are prohibited), day use area with a gravel boat ramp, campground, and hiking/equestrian trails. Construction of the reservoir was part of the Mill Creek Project, completed in 1981, which also included a pressurized irrigation water delivery system. In 2000, the site was constructed into a campground and day use area for visitors to enjoy the surrounding recreational activities and scenic vistas. Located 10 miles south of Moab, Ken's Lake is surrounded by red rock fins to the east, sage brush flats to the south and west, and a reservoir to the north. Distant views from the campground also include the La Sal Mountains and red rock Moab Rim. This site is located at 5,085 feet elevation, similar to Moab. Be prepared October to March for lows below freezing and from June to August highs from 95 to above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. This campground is comprised of loops A and B. Loop A has no vegetation providing shade and is closed during low use season (summer and winter; exact dates vary each year). Loop B stays open year round and has a variety of sites with juniper and cottonwood trees providing shade and privacy. Loop A is popular with visitors that have large motorhomes and trailers. Loop B has smaller sites and it is difficult for large motorhomes and trailers to turn-around. The south end of the Steel Bender Jeep Safari Route runs next to the campground, so Off Highway Vehicle (OHV) users are also drawn to this area. Other popular activities originating from the campground or day use area include: hiking, horseback riding, fishing, and non-motorized boating. There are over 3 miles of trails in the lake vicinity with views of the Moab Valley, Faux Falls, La Sal Mountains, and Ken's Lake.

The Pacific Crest Trail enters on the northeast from Walker Pass and crosses the area for 16 miles, exiting over Bird Spring Pass to the south. Four-wheel-drive roads forge into the area on non-Wilderness intrusions from the east up Horse Canyon and Cow Heaven Canyon, both accessible from State Highway 14. You should be able to find water in numerous springs. However, due to the arid environment and dry conditions be sure to carry plenty of water. Potable drinking water may not be available year round. Visitors should not drink from creeks and springs without properly treating the water. Recommended treatment is to bring clear water to a rolling boil for 5 minutes or use a filter/purifying system that eliminates giardia and waterborne bacteria. For more information about this wilderness, please visit Wilderness Connect. Overview Embracing the eroded hills, canyons, and bajadas of the Scodie Mountains--the southernmost reach of the Sierra Nevada--Kiavah Wilderness lies primarily within Sequoia National Forest but includes a portion on BLM land. Here in the transition zone between the Sierra Nevada and the Mojave Desert, you'll find an unusual mix of plants and animals: creosote bush, Joshua tree, burro bush, and shadscale growing near pinion pine, juniper, canyon oak, and gray pine; yellow-eared pocket mice and lizards watching the skies for raptors.",

King Peak, the highest point at 4,088 feet, is only 3-miles from the ocean. King Range is the Nation's very first National Conservation Area, designated in 1970. The King Range encompasses 68,000 acres along 35-miles of California's dramatic north coast, where the landscape was too rugged for highway building, forcing State Highway 1 inland. Accessible by only a few back roads, this remote region of mountains and seascapes is also known as California's Lost Coast. The King Range's Douglas fir-covered peaks attract hikers, hunters, and campers, while the coast beckons to surfers, anglers, beachcombers, and many others. World-class mountain bike trails, and 42,585 acres of coastal wilderness are two of the highlights of this incredibly unique area. The King Range NCA contains over 80 miles of hiking trails spanning from the beach to the highest peaks. Most of the upland trails are strenuous due to the steep rugged nature of the area. In addition to mileage, pay attention to the elevation changes listed in the trail descriptions. Several different connector trails allow for loop hikes. The backcountry was designated as official wilderness on October 17, 2006 and the BLM manages it accordingly, so expect no facilities and minimal signing on trails. Some of the lesser used trails (such as Rattlesnake Ridge, Spanish Ridge and Cooskie Creek) may be somewhat overgrown and difficult to follow. Its best to carry a map and compass with you and call the Visitor Center (707)986-5400 before your trip for the latest trail conditions. Winter Weather & Ocean Advisory: Winter storms & waves in the King Range NCA can make portions or all of the Lost Coast Trail dangerous and even impossible to traverse, regardless of tidal level. Additionally, heavy rains may cause downed trees or landslides along upland trails. Heavy rains may cause stream crossings to become hazardous and may impede travel. We at BLM recommend that you do not cross creeks that are above your knee. Be patient. Wait for water level to subside. Please contact the King Range Project Office at (707) 986-5400 for updates on current conditions and check tides Tide Predictions - NOAA Tides & Currents and The National Weather Service (http://www. weather. gov/eka/) & NDBC - National Weather Service Marine Forecast FZUS56 KEKA (noaa. gov) for current coastal conditions.

After basaltic flood lavas covered much of eastern Oregon about 5 to 23 million years ago, great blocks of the Earth’s crust subsequently tilted, resulting in the raised scarp and lakebed seen today.

    "description": "The Deschutes River begins its journey high in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon at Little Lava Lake and travels through deep rimrock-lined canyons on its 252-mile course north to the Columbia River. The last 100 miles of this path were designated as an Oregon Scenic Waterway in 1970 and a Federal Wild and Scenic River in 1988. The Lower Deschutes River is managed cooperatively by three agencies:  Prineville District Bureau of Land Management; the  Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs; and  Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. Boater Passes are required year-round, for both day and overnight use, for anyone using a watercraft or any other floating device as a means of transport on the Lower Deschutes River. Access is restricted to a limited number of boaters on some segments during peak use periods. Limited Entry passes can be reserved up to 26 weeks in advance. Learn more about these limits, the four unique  Lower Deschutes River segments  and camping guidelines along the Lower Deschutes River. The Deschutes has a rich cultural history, providing food and water for thousands of years to the Warm Springs and Wasco people moving seasonally through the area. In the 1800s, due to increasing pressure from settlers, many moved to the lands now known as the Warm Springs Reservation, which borders much of the west side of the Lower Deschutes. Members of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs retain their fishing rights and can be seen dip net fishing the traditional way, leaning from platforms over the river just below Sherars Falls. The Deschutes has a unique flow that is fairly uniform compared to other similar rivers. The annual fluctuation between flows is small due to the many nourishing springs that feed the river in the upper reaches, and the effects of the Pelton Reregulation Dam, which delivers a uniform flow for the last 100 miles. Visitors on the river pass through steep canyons that reveal their volcanic origin in the towering basalt columns lining the rims. The elevation drops from 1,393 feet at Pelton Dam to 160 feet at its confluence with the Columbia River. The average gradient is 13 feet per mile and is relatively constant throughout its length. The most significant drops in gradient are Sherars Falls (River Mile 44), with a vertical drop of 15 feet, and Whitehorse Rapids (River Mile 75), with a gradient of approximately 35-40 feet over one mile. Many outstanding opportunities draw people to the Lower Deschutes River. Thousands come every year to enjoy world class fishing, exciting whitewater and beautiful scenery. No matter where you are along the Lower Deschutes, you will experience an incredible geologic and cultural history, a diverse community of fish, wildlife and vegetation, and an abundance of recreational opportunities. Whatever you plan to do, if you want to stay overnight, arrive early to get a campsite, especially during summer weekends. Come enjoy a unique opportunity to discover the historic and present day wonders of the Deschutes River canyon!

    "description": "The 425-mile Salmon River is one of the longest free-flowing river in the lower 48 states. The river begins at not much more than a trickle at an elevation of about 8,000 feet in the Sawtooth and Whitecloud Mountains of central Idaho. It gathers force as it makes its way northeast and then west, fed by snows from the Sawtooth and Salmon River Mountains in the south and the Clearwater and Bitterroot Mountains in the north. About 150 miles further on its westward course, the Salmon River has carved the second deepest canyon in North America, which effectively splits Idaho in half. The section known as the Lower Salmon River begins at Vinegar Creek, 25 miles above the town of Riggins. At Riggins, the river swings north and then west for 87 miles where it then meets the Snake River. The Salmon and Snake combine to flow into the Columbia River and eventually into the ocean. The drainage area of the Salmon River, which lies entirely within Idaho's borders, encompasses approximately 13,550 square miles. The river and its canyon are truly remarkable in this \"pool and drop\" river where difficult rapids are located in the narrow canyons. The numerous unusual white sand beaches offer camping and serve as a reminder that this river is still free flowing. The 20-mile stretch of the Snake River, from the confluence with the Salmon River to the Heller Bar take-out near the confluence with the Grande Ronde River, contains slower moving water with some rapids and is often characterized by stiff up-canyon winds. Along the Lower Salmon River, the BLM manages the following sites: Hammer Creek, Island Bar, Lucile, Old Lucile, Pine Bar, Shorts Bar, Skookumchuck, Slate Creek and White Bird Gravel Pit. The Lower Salmon River from Vinegar Creek to the confluence with the Snake River features 112 miles of Class II-IV whitewater in one of the deepest canyons in the United States. Much of the 53 miles of the river, from White Bird downstream to the confluence of the Snake and Salmon Rivers, is roadless and accessible only by boat. The Lower Salmon is a suitable river for future Wild and Scenic River designation. The BLM recreation sites with provide access to the Lower Salmon are Island Bar, Lucile, Old Lucile, Shorts Bar, Slate Creek, Skookumchuck, White Bird, Hammer Creek and Pine Bar. Be sure to check those sites for more information and amenities for boat ramps or camping. For river maps, authorized outfitters and shuttle services, go to the links below.

It is well known for excellent whitewater boating, wildflower viewing, camping, swimming, and recreational gold panning/prospecting. Visitors will have plenty to do in the Merced River Recreation Area during every season. Springtime comes early to the Merced River Canyon and by March the wildflower season is well on its way—lasting into May. Easy access, un-damned flows, and excellent whitewater boating attract rafters and kayakers during the spring runoff (April through July). Commercial rafting trips are available from BLM permitted outfitters. It is a very popular swimming destination during the hot California foothill summers with some of the clearest swimming holes around. Gold panning and prospecting have never fallen out of favor since the 1850’s when this canyon had a large mining population. In autumn the crowds subside and the Merced River Recreation Area provides more solitude while still offering most of the appeal and activities as earlier in the year. By winter, true solitude can be found. The weather is usually quite warm and sunny between storms. Daytime highs in the 60’s and overnight lows in the 30’s are common. While some activities are best in specific seasons, there are many things to do all year long. Bird watching is good throughout the area most of the year. Fishing is popular for trout and bass along the entire river. Biking along the gravel roads and trails is popular with families and experienced mountain bikers alike. Hiking is great anytime of the year. The Merced River Trail continues on downstream from the end of the campground River Road and brings hikers or bikers to the North Fork of the Merced and beyond. The Burma Grade is another popular route to explore on foot, bike, or high-clearance vehicle. This scenic backroad climbs steeply out of the Merced Canyon and eventually leads to Greely Hill or Buck Meadows (highway 120). McCabe Flat Campground Overview After crossing the historic Briceburg Suspension Bridge, McCabe Flat Campground is 2. 2 miles downstream along the Merced River Road. This is the first of three campgrounds operated by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) along the Wild and Scenic Merced River. This is a popular destination campground during spring and summer. McCabe Flat Campground has a large designated swimming area and beach. No dogs are allowed on the beach or swimming area! Dogs are allowed on leash at all other locations managed by BLM in the region. There are eight (8) walk-in campsites and three (3) drive-up campsites. The walk-in sites are between 50 and 200 feet from the parking lot. An accessible crushed rock trail leads to each site.

    "description": "Over 100 years ago, emigrants on the Oregon Trail passed through what is now the Milner Historic Recreation Area, creating ruts as they traveled through the soft soil of the area. Some of the emigrants chose to camp here, resting before continuing the long journey ahead. The historic recreation area preserves these still visible Oregon Trail ruts. Just north of the recreation area's west entrance is an interpretive shelter and a hiking trail that leads to some of the Oregon Trail ruts. The historic recreation has a 1. 3-mile, paved accessible walking path that follows the historic ruts, with interpretive panels along the way discussing the history of the area. Milner Historic Recreation Area also offers ample opportunities for recreation, including 4 miles of Snake River shoreline that make it the largest accessible section of public land along the river in the Magic Valley. Enjoying this shoreline is made easier with the availability of two boat ramps within the recreation area, one of which includes a kayak/canoe launch to assist with the use of non-motorized watercraft. Fishing the Snake River for bass, perch, catfish, trout, and carp is popular whether from boat or shore. The area's basalt cliffs and surrounding sagebrush/grassland are a year-round haven for songbirds, waterfowl, upland birds, rabbits, and reptiles. Mule deer can often be seen along the tree lines and near the river. Scattered through the historic recreation area are 26 campsites with fire rings, picnic tables and vault toilets located nearby. Some campsites situated near the river's edge have docks from which campers can swim, fish, or boat. One of the boat ramps includes a picnic area with shade structures, picnic tables, grills, and horseshoe pits. This is a US fee site that currently has a $5 day-use fee and $15-per-night camping fee to include 2 vehicles. Additional vehicles will be charged $5 per night per vehicle. Annual passes are available by contacting the Burley Field Office. Idaho State Park Passes are not accepted. No reservations are available, and all sites are first come, first served. Camping is allowed only in numbered and designated sites. Currently there is no water, electric hook ups, or dump station on-site. RV's and large trailers are recommended to use the west entrance into the historic recreation area due to low clearance on the east end. While there are camp sites that can accommodate larger RV's, not all sites are RV friendly, so enter with caution. Bring your own firewood as cutting vegetation on-site is prohibited. Shooting of firearms is prohibited within 100 yards of any picnic, camping, scenic viewing, boat ramp, or gathering site. Annual Pass: $50 for unlimited day use at Milner Historic Recreation Area and Lud Drexler Park. Reduces camping rate to $5 per site per night, to include two vehicles.

It stretches from Wallowa Lake, Oregon, across Idaho to the Bear Paw National Historic Trail in Chinook, Montana. Before and after Lewis and Clark, the Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) homeland extended throughout central Idaho, northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. Here, the Nez Perce hunted, fished, collected camas and biscuitroot, and raised their children passing on knowledge acquired over millennia. As fur trappers, traders, settlers, soldiers, missionaries, and farmers moved into or through the area, the Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) and their lands underwent some very big changes. Tensions increased between the Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) and these new people. Anxious to avoid conflict, the Nez Perce signed a treaty to create a large reservation encompassing their traditional homeland. After gold was discovered inside the reservation in 1863 and as miners and settlers moved in to the reservation, a new treaty reduced the original reservation by 90 percent. Some tribal leaders rejected the new treaty. In May of 1877, the U. S. government ordered the “non-treaty” Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) to relocate to the new reservation by June 14. After violence erupted, Chief Joseph and other Nez Perce leaders, including Toohoolhoolzote, decided it would be better to flee to Canada than to relocate to the reduced reservation. In 1877, 750 Nez Perce—two-thirds of them women, children, the elderly and the sick and with 2,000 of their own horses—battled and eluded more than 2,000 U. S. Army soldiers and other pursuers over 1,100 miles. They finally surrendered at Bear Paw, Montana, just shy of the Canadian border.

Trails leading to the North Fork are used by hikers, backpackers, pack and saddle stock users, gold panners, and by whitewater recreationists gaining access to the river at Euchre Bar. Whitewater rafting, hiking, backpacking, swimming, recreational gold panning, fishing, nature study and picnicking are among the most popular activities. Whitewater recreation through this segment of river is  Class V  which means experts only, and only under certain conditions of flow.

    "description": "The twin Menan Buttes are two of the world’s largest tuff cones - volcanoes that form when basaltic magma boils up through ground water. These extinct volcanoes were formed by violent eruptions 10,000 years ago. The Menan Buttes are unusual formations because they erupted through the cold waters of the Snake River which flowed where the Buttes stand today. When molten magma met the cold river water it cooled so quickly crystals were unable to form, and the lava solidified into glass called tachylite. The heat of the magma flashed the river water to steam, shattering the glass into tiny fragments that welded together as the hot ash settled to the ground. The Menan Buttes are unique because these are the only volcanic eruptions that occurred in freshwater in the United States, which is why North Menan Butte is designated as a National Natural Landmark and as a Research Natural Area. These designations help preserve the Butte so visitors can enjoy and study this unique geologic area in its natural condition. North Menan Butte is also designated as a BLM Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC). The trail to the summit of the North Butte offers visitors exceptional opportunities to explore the unique geology and natural history of this area. Facilities: Vault toilet, interpretive signs Length: 3. 1 mile trail from parking area to the top, around the rim and back down (0. 6 miles cutting through the bowl of the butte) There are no day-use fees associated with this site. Know before you go: North Menan Butte is open to non-motorized recreation activities only. Help protect important vegetation and prevent erosion by minimizing impact to the area. Motorized vehicles have traveled up the butte in the past, creating scars that can be seen from the parking area. These scars will take a long time to rehabilitate naturally. • Leave what you find so that others may share your sense of discovery. • Be courteous and do not disturb wildlife. • Trash? Pack it in. Pack it out. • Before setting off on your journey, please consider the following safety concerns: • Take plenty of water. This environment is hot and dry at certain times of the year. • Watch your footing. Slippery and rocky surfaces are common in this area. • Watch out for rattlesnakes.

Continue roughly 2.7 miles until you see the Grafton Cemetery parking area (Do not turn south onto Smithsonian Butte Road, stay in the valley). You can park at the cemetery parking area and walk or ride your bike south on a dirt two track. The trail will branch off of this road a few hundred feet ahead. You can do the trail as a hike up and hike/bike back down. Looping options are difficult and would require going around the mesa on Smithsonian Butte Road.",

An old four-wheel-drive track crosses the area from northwest to southeast, and a long waterless way it is. The northeastern border is the Nevada state line. For more information about this wilderness, please visit Wilderness Connect. Overview The Pahrump Valley in the north, the Mesquite Valley in the southeast, and the California Valley in the west join forces in this desolate, seldom-visited Wilderness. Alluvial slopes in all three valleys ascend gradually southward into the northern Kingston Range, which also lies within the Wilderness. In the mountains, you'll find a rugged piece of earth with many canyons, winding washes, and bajadas. Elevations range from 2,720 feet on a valley floor to 4,569 feet on a mountain summit. The three dry valleys are dotted with desert shrubs and yucca.",

    "description": "Painted Rock Petroglyph Site, approximately 90 miles southwest of Phoenix, Arizona, provides visitors the opportunity to view an archaeological site containing hundreds of figures and designs carved into rocks, known as petroglyphs. These were produced centuries ago by indigenous peoples. This site is considered important and even sacred to many of the Native American tribes in southern Arizona. Please keep this in mind when you visit and be respectful. Climbing on the rocks is prohibited and we ask that you keep dogs out of the area. There are also inscriptions made by people who passed through during historic times. Many important trails are near the site, some of which have been traveled for thousands of years. The 1775 expedition of Juan Bautista de Anza passed nearby on his way to deliver soldiers, padres, settlers, and their livestock to a new home in northern California to secure the area for Spain. In 1846, the Mormon Battalion passed through, following Philip St. George Cooke along some segments of this trail to help secure California from Mexico. This venture included road building tasks along the trail, assuring that future trips could accommodate wagons. A need to improve communication and travel from east to west prompted Congress to fund a stage line. The result was the Butterfield Overland Stage Route, which began service in 1858 and traveled by this site. This mail and freight service guaranteed that the mail, freight, or passengers would be able to travel from Saint Louis to San Francisco in 25 days. Use was halted when the railroad was constructed in 1879. Formerly a unit of the Arizona State Park system, jurisdiction of Painted Rock Petroglyph Site returned to the Bureau of Land Management in 1989.

The landscape surrounding it is classic eastern Oregon high desert: scattered sagebrush, rocky rimrock outcroppings, and marshy fringes that attract birds and offer tranquil scenery. As the story goes, the reservoir, and the creek that feeds it, were named ‘Poison Creek’ not because of actual toxins, but due to early incidents where local cattle became ill after grazing on wild parsnip plants growing nearby.

Rice Canyon is open to all types of vehicles such as motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATV), utility terrain vehicles (UTV) and four-wheel drive vehicles. The area provides excellent motorcycle hill-climb opportunities for the more experienced rider as well as loop track riding. Rice Canyon is also popular for training the more novice rider. Visitors can also access the OHV area by trail off Highway 139 at Antelope Mountain. Although OHV riders do not have to stay on the trails, some of the more popular track loops are marked with numbered signs displaying difficulty rating and recommended vehicle type. The trails run both ways, so anticipate users riding in both directions. The main trailhead has facilities such as BBQs and picnic tables, loading ramps, a vault toilet facility. Additional improvements will continue including construction of new trails and rock crawling areas. For comments or ideas for improvements to the Rice Canyon Open OHV area, contact the BLM Eagle Lake Recreation Planner at 530-252-5303. See more photos of the Rice Canyon OHV Area. Funding for the area has been through the California State Parks OHV green sticker grant program. For more information or to review current and past grants visit the:  CA State Parks .

    "description": "Each year, approximately 20,000 people float the Wild section of the river, where only a few trails, private lodges and BLM or Forest Service stations are evidence of man's intrusion. To help preserve the Rogue for future float trips, fishing, swimming, wildlife viewing, hiking, and enjoyment of its pristine beauty, a permit system is administered by the BLM. Permits are available year-round on the Wild section. During the peak season, May 15 - October 15, permits must be obtained through the competitive process. A self-issued non-competitive permit is available October 16 - May 14. Wild section float permit regulations are uniform throughout the year, requiring fire pans and toilet systems. While the permit system helps track and regulate use, keeping this remote wilderness untrammelled by man, you, the user, must learn and practice  Leave No Trace ethics. River conditions fluctuate seasonally. The autumn and spring vary in weather and water levels. Winter months are subject to cold temperatures and flood-stage water levels. During the peak summer season, the Rogue has warm temperatures, abundant sunshine and consistent flow rates. Boaters should always check road conditions, particularly during early- and shoulder-season trips, as shuttle routes will vary with road closures. The Rogue is a well-recognized whitewater/wilderness float trip, known for its scenic beauty and emerald waters offering a remote floating experience with many technical rapids. These class III and IV+ rapids offer boating excitement for both families and experienced adventurers. Hiking on the remote Rogue River Trail, which parallels the entire Wild section of the Rogue River, is accessible from most river campsites. For more information, be sure to contact the Forest Service     Gold Beach Ranger District or the BLM  Medford District for the latest conditions and access to the spectacular Wild Rogue Wilderness Area! Float Permit Reservation Information: A float permit is available year-round for the Wild section of the Rogue River. A lottery is used to allocate the control season (May 15 - October 15) launches. Lottery applications for the control season are accepted on Recreation. gov annually Dec. 1 - Jan. 31. Pre- and post-control season launches are obtained by filling out a self-issued permit available at Smullin Visitor Center and Grave Creek Boat Launch access. Overview:Surrounded by the lush forests and rugged mountains of Southern Oregon, the Rogue National Wild and Scenic River was one of the original eight rivers designated Wild and Scenic in 1968. The Rogue flows 215 miles from Crater Lake to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. From seven miles west of Grants Pass to 11 miles east of Gold Beach, the 84-mile long National Wild and Scenic portion is cooperatively managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the US Forest Service.",

    "description": "The Ruby-Horsethief section of the Colorado River, from Loma, Colorado, to Westwater, Utah, is a 25-mile stretch of mostly flat-water with sections of Class I and II rapids. This section of the Colorado runs through beautiful red rock canyons and has many day hike opportunities offering both solitude and exploration. The Black Rocks section is composed of rock known as Vishnu schist, which dates back about 1. 7 billion years. This same rock, which geologists refer to as \"an unconformity\",is exposed in certain sections of the Grand Canyon. There is an abundance of wildlife in the area including great blue herons, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, mule deer, and desert bighorn sheep. Please note that humans are prohibited from approaching within a 0. 5 mile of eagle nests or harassing the birds in any way. Look up in old cottonwoods trees and you are likely to spot the nests and eagles. Motorized use is allowed in Ruby Canyon. Visitors can expect to see motorized and non-motorized craft in Ruby Canyon. Due to limited camping in this 25-mile stretch of the Colorado, overnight camping permits are required year-round and must be reserved in advance. Permits are available 60 days in advance. During the months of May through September, there is a fee for the overnight camping permit and reservation, although children 16 years old and under camp for free, year-round. From November through April, an overnight camping permit is required, however, a fee is charged for the reservation only (there is no fee for the overnight camping permit). There is a maximum of 25 heartbeats per group, including adults, children, and dogs (two dogs per group). Please note, dogs are considered part of your permit's group total and fees are assessed for dogs just as they are for people. A permit is not required for day use in Ruby-Horsethief. Seasonal Information: Ruby-Horsethief is a remote section of river with spotty to non-existent cell service. There are no other takeouts until Westwater, and rescues are long and cumbersome. Conditions vary depending on seasonal flows, especially for canoeists. Please see the Ruby-Horsethief Boating Information page for more information. Spring weather can be extremely variable with hot days followed by snow followed by high winds followed by cold rains. Summer days can be very hot and buggy. There is little shade along the river. Rain storms are usually short but somewhat violent. Summer nights are usually comfortable. Fall provides the most consistent weather with warm days, cool nights, and infrequent rain. However, several days of long, cold, heavy and steady rain can occur at any time. The key is being prepared for almost anything! Streamflow: Along this section of river you will encounter Class I and II rapids. It is recommended you check the streamflow data when planning your trip, especially during spring runoff, which can vary greatly from year to year. Extra care is needed with any type of watercraft when the streamflow is over 30,000 CFS (cubic feet per second). Canoes are not recommended at all until the streamflow drops below 20,000 CFS, and between 10,000 and 20,000 CFS only highly experienced canoeists should attempt this section of river. Family raft trips are best done when the river drops to below 5,000 CFS. Spring runoff causes the river to become muddy with heavy debris. You can also check the Colorado River Outfitters Association Water Report. Overview: The Ruby-Horsethief section of the Colorado River, from Loma, Colorado, to Westwater, Utah, is a 25-mile stretch of mostly flat-water with sections of Class I and II rapids. This section of the Colorado runs through beautiful red rock canyons and has many day hike opportunities offering both solitude and exploration. The Black Rocks section is composed of rock known as Vishnu schist, which dates back about 1. 7 billion years. This same rock, which geologists refer to as \"an unconformity\",is exposed in certain sections of the Grand Canyon.",

The unspoiled 1. 6-million acre Bitterroot Range and Continental Divide serve as Idaho’s eastern border. This area was visited by the Corps of Discovery’s Lewis and Clark in 1805. Today, visitors can stand on the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and see the same expansive view that greeted the Corps of Discovery. As its name would suggest, Salmon is actively engaged in fish issues. Fish biologists work hard with local partners to create suitable habitat and remove fish passage barriers along several integral stream networks in the Lemhi valley drainage.

    "description": "The South Fork of the Snake River flows for 66 miles across southeastern Idaho, through high mountain valleys, rugged canyons, and broad flood plains to its confluence with the Henrys Fork of the Snake near the Menan Buttes. It flows northwest from Palisades Dam in Swan Valley. For the first nine miles, the river runs through a narrow channel, then widens and flows around several island complexes. A waterfall can be seen just upstream from the Swan Valley Bridge where Fall Creek cascades into the river. Downstream of Conant launch the river leaves Highway 26 and enters a scenic canyon. The impressive canyon scenery continues downstream until near Heise Hot Springs, where the cliffs give way to a level, but extremely dynamic, flood plain. The South Fork supports the largest riparian cottonwood gallery forest in the West and is among the most unique and diverse ecosystems in Idaho. It is also home to 126 bird species, including 21 raptors, meriting a \"National Important Bird Area\" designation. The river also supports the largest native cutthroat fishery outside of Yellowstone National Park. The corridor is also home for an impressive array of other wildlife including moose, deer, elk, mountain goats, mountain lions, black bears, bobcats, coyotes, river otter, beaver, fox, and mink. The South Fork is also located near some of the world's best known recreation areas including Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Island Park, Targhee National Forest, Teton River, Henrys Lake State Park and the Henry's Fork of the Snake River. Among recreationists throughout the country, the South Fork is known as a premier blue ribbon trout fishery, and was selected as the host site for the 1997 World Fly-Fishing Championship. More than 300,000 anglers, campers, hikers, boaters and other recreationists use the South Fork each year. Numerous hiking trails start near the South Fork. The Canyon Rim Trail begins in Black Canyon and follows the canyon upriver to Dry Canyon, providing magnificent views of the river below. A variety of trails exist on the Targhee National Forest in the Swan Valley area and along the South Fork. Some of these trails are available for mountain biking and off-highway vehicles. The river is eligible for inclusion in the nation's Wild and Scenic river system. Land ownership in the corridor is a mixture of the Bureau of Land Management, USDA Forest Service, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, State of Idaho, counties, and private interests. Along the Snake River corridor there are several boat access spots which include Byington, Conant, Lorenzo, and Menan.

For more information on any of the principles listed below, please visit Leave No Trace, Visit the Leave No Trace, Inc. website. Motorized equipment and equipment used for mechanical transport are generally prohibited on all federal lands designated as wilderness. This includes the use of motor vehicles (including OHVs), motorboats, motorized equipment, bicycles, hang gliders, wagons, carts, portage wheels, and the landing of aircraft including helicopters, unless provided for in specific legislation. In a few areas some exceptions allowing the use of motorized equipment or mechanical transport are described in the special regulations in effect for a specific area. Contact the agency for more information about regulations. Overview The Sylvania Mountains are shared by California and Nevada, and the Wilderness starts on the desert floor and rises eastward over gradually rolling hills to rough and mountainous terrain reaching nearly 8,000 feet in height. Sagebrush scrub dominates the vegetation on the east, and gives way to piñon pine and juniper at the higher elevations.

The land and the rugged, surrounding uplands (commonly call the Missouri Breaks) are defined in part by their history. The entire region was the homeland and lifeblood of American Indians. The river served as the pathway for Lewis and Clark, then the waterway for steamboats and an attraction for fur trappers and traders. Later, the river and the Missouri Breaks were sanctuaries for desperados trying to stay a step ahead of the law.

    "description": "The Willcox Dry Lake or Playa, the largest “dry lake” in Arizona, is a remnant of the pluvial Lake Cochise. Unlike similar dry lakes, the black mud below the surface contains a rich fossil pollen record of the pluvial periods of the Pleistocene epoch, a significant geological period that lasted from approximately 2. 58 million to 11,700 years ago. The site has become a seasonal night-time roosting area for 4,000-8,000 sandhill cranes and contains the greatest variety of tiger beetles in the United States.",

Overview A short drive up the gravel road that leads to the Bureau of Land Management’s Zapata Falls Campground (CG) will let visitors to the area see the San Luis Valley and Great Sand Dunes National Park & Preserve from a whole new perspective. The campground offers bird’s-eye views of the valley floor below, the San Juan Mountains to the west, the adjacent Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, and several 14er’s and many other towering peaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountain range that Zapata Falls CG sits on — not to mention spectacular sunrises, sunsets and night skies!",

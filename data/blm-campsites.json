    "description": "Located in the heart of the Rockies near the Idaho/Montana border, the Salmon Field Office, which manages almost 500,000 acres of public lands, provides spectacular scenery and great opportunities for adventure around every turn. The Salmon River, Bitterroot, and Lemhi ranges offer endless hiking, fishing, hunting and exploration opportunities. Hikers and nature lovers find scenic and rugged terrain in the isolated, often-overlooked Lemhi Range where elk, deer, mountain goats, moose and black bears are abundant. The Salmon River meanders through the second-deepest gorge on the continent and is well-known as Idaho’s best steelhead fishing area, along with rainbow and cutthroat trout. Rafters enjoy scenic floating and fishing along the calmer stretches of the river near the town of Salmon, or tackling challenging whitewater (Class I-IV) on the stretch of river west of North Fork, Idaho. The unspoiled 1.6-million acre Bitterroot Range and Continental Divide serve as Idaho’s eastern border. This area was visited by the Corps of Discovery’s Lewis and Clark in 1805. Today, visitors can stand on the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and see the same expansive view that greeted the Corps of Discovery. As its name would suggest, Salmon is actively engaged in fish issues. Fish biologists work hard with local partners to create suitable habitat and remove fish passage barriers along several integral stream networks in the Lemhi valley drainage. Discovery Hill area, located right outside the town, is an up and coming recreation site offering a podcast tour, mountain biking, disc golf and everything in between. The office is currently working on finishing their travel management planning for the South Half of the field office.\n\nOverview Located in the heart of the Rockies near the Idaho/Montana border, the Salmon Field Office, which manages almost 500,000 acres of public lands, provides spectacular scenery and great opportunities for adventure around every turn.

It stretches from Wallowa Lake, Oregon, across Idaho to the Bear Paw National Historic Trail in Chinook, Montana. Before and after Lewis and Clark, the Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) homeland extended throughout central Idaho, northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. Here, the Nez Perce hunted, fished, collected camas and biscuitroot, and raised their children passing on knowledge acquired over millennia. As fur trappers, traders, settlers, soldiers, missionaries, and farmers moved into or through the area, the Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) and their lands underwent some very big changes. Tensions increased between the Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) and these new people. Anxious to avoid conflict, the Nez Perce signed a treaty to create a large reservation encompassing their traditional homeland. After gold was discovered inside the reservation in 1863 and as miners and settlers moved in to the reservation, a new treaty reduced the original reservation by 90 percent. Some tribal leaders rejected the new treaty. In May of 1877, the U.S. government ordered the “non-treaty” Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) to relocate to the new reservation by June 14. After violence erupted, Chief Joseph and other Nez Perce leaders, including Toohoolhoolzote, decided it would be better to flee to Canada than to relocate to the reduced reservation. In 1877, 750 Nez Perce—two-thirds of them women, children, the elderly and the sick and with 2,000 of their own horses—battled and eluded more than 2,000 U.S. Army soldiers and other pursuers over 1,100 miles. They finally surrendered at Bear Paw, Montana, just shy of the Canadian border.\n\nOverview Congress established the Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) National Historic Trail Historic Trail in 1986.

Of the islands we do manage, many are close to other state-owned and privately owned islands, so it's critical that visitors determine whether an island is public land before using it.

As a result of evaporating mineral-laden surface water, a crust has formed in the lake, creating a glistening white bed of salt that has become a famous attraction for Carrizo.\n\nThe Carrizo Plain is traversed by the San Andreas Fault, providing spectacular topography along the eastern edge. Ridges rise sharply from the plain to form the Panorama and Elkhorn Hills. Temporary pools and salt-encrusted ponds appear along the fault, trapping rainwater to create stunning scenery.\n\nPainted Rock, a large, U-shaped rock outcrop just south of the Goodwin Education Center, features what was once an elaborate, multicolored pictograph site created by the Chumash, a Native American people who historically inhabited the coastal regions of California. Both the interior and exterior sides have paintings, which include geometric images as well as human figures, snakes and aquatic images.\n\nThere are numerous seasonal recreational opportunities for visitors, many of them focused on the plain's abundant birds and wildflowers. Aside from the organized tours available, hiking, biking, birding, wildlife viewing and scenic drives are all popular activities for guests.\n\nThe San Andreas, Soda Lake, Elkhorn and Seven Mile roads within the monument, all combine to offer a stunning 70-mile scenic loop drive, and the nearby Goodwin Educational Center provides interpretive exhibits and other educational programs.\n\nOverview: Carrizo Plain National Monument is home to a number of curiously beautiful sights, both natural and man-made.

    "description": "The Green River enters Desolation Canyon just north of Sand Wash as it exits the Uinta Basin. Canyon walls are stream and lake deposits of the Eocene age then transition into the Cretaceous delta and sea deposits of Gray Canyon.\n\nAlong the river, the riparian zone holds willow, cottonwood, box elder and other woody riparian species and provides critical habitat to neo-tropical migrant birds, nesting waterfowl, and wintering deer and elk. Moving away from the cool shade of the riparian zone, one immediately enters a desert environment dominated by salt shrubs and bunch grasses. There is a small sagebrush zone that gives way to pinyon and juniper slopes. The view is always dominated by rock and cliff. Douglas fir finds a home in protected, well watered alcoves.\n\nOver sixty riffles and rapids punctuate the trip. None are particularly difficult - a dozen or so can cause some trouble for the unprepared traveler. Camping tends to be idyllic on a clean sandy beach in front of a grove of cottonwood trees which offer shade and a windbreak. More than 60 side canyons descend from the plateau to meet the Green River. Every side canyon holds a surprise. In a few, a cold, clear stream pours into a warm silty river. Prehistoric rock art is prolific along with the ruins of dwellings, towers and granaries.\n\nBetween Sand Wash and Nefertiti Rapid, users set their own itinerary. There are a number of hiking trails in the canyon. Of the 84 mile long river segment, 66 miles are within the Desolation Canyon Wilderness Study Area - the largest in the lower 48 states.\n\nThe Desolation Canyon National Historic Landmark (NHL) extends one mile on either side of the river from Nine Mile Creek to Florence Creek. The NHL was designated by the Secretary of the Interior in 1969 as part of the centennial celebration of the 1869 exploration of the Green and Colorado Rivers by John Wesley Powell.\n\nThere is a primitive boat ramp at Sand Wash, a primitive eight-site campground, a contact/information station, staffed ranger station and toilets. Trash receptacles and water are not provided. With the remoteness of the area groups can camp the night before at Sand Wash. Due to frequent mosquito plagues, Sand Wash offers four campsites with screened cabins. Contact the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Price Field Office for cabin reservations at (435) 636-3600. This contrasts with the more developed Swaseys Boat Ramp where there is a large concrete boat ramp along with improved parking, toilets and trash removal services.\n\nRiver left, (east of the river) of the Ute Tribal Lands (above Coal Creek) has a 75 foot buffer that allows camping with a permit issued from the Ute Tribe. All recreational activities (e.g. hiking, sightseeing) on the river left (east side of the river) without a tribal permit are strictly prohibited.\n\nYou must hold a valid, BLM Desolation Canyon permit prior to obtaining the Ute Tribal permit. Ute Tribal permits may be purchased online.\n\nOverview: The Green River enters Desolation Canyon just north of Sand Wash as it exits the Uinta Basin.
